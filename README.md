# Custom Settings Tweaker

Allows you to change and fine-tune several settings in a Custom mode game (new or existing).     
Should be compatible with other mods that also alter these settings, just leave the corresponding setting in this mod at ```Game Default``` so the other mod alters it as intended.

## Requirements
[MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)

[ModSettings](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings/releases)

## Installation:
1. Download ```CustomSettingsTweaker.dll``` from [releases](https://github.com/GruffCassquatch/ChooseStartingLocation/releases)
2. Drop ```CustomSettingsTweaker.dll``` into your Mods folder
3. If you are updating from an older version, delete the ```CustomSettingsTweaker.json``` from your Mods folder as old json's can cause errors if the mod's Settings have been changed

## Uninstallation:
Delete ```CustomSettingsTweaker.dll``` and ```CustomSettingsTweaker.json``` files from your Mods folder

## Using The Mod
1. Open the ```Options``` menu
2. Open the ```Mod Settings``` menu
3. Scroll across to the ```Custom Settings Tweaker``` menu
4. Mod Options:
	* ```Disabled:``` Mod is disabled; the game will be completely unmodified
	* ```Enabled:``` Mod is enabled; the settings you choose will be applied when playing Custom mode games
	* For the rest of the options: 
	    * ```Game Default``` nothing will be changed in regards to that setting
	    * ```Low```, ```Medium```, ```High``` etc. corresponds to the default game value for that setting (e.g. as if you chose that option when starting the game)
	    * ```Custom``` choose a custom value using the slider. For long sliders, use your mouse to get close to the value you want and then use the left/right arrow keys on your keyboard to get the exact number
	    * Thirst and Condition Recovery include some additional presets for convenience
	    * Each setting has a description with additional information
5. Click ```CONFIRM``` to apply your changes or ```BACK``` to exit without applying changes
6. If you make changes to the mod's settings while in-game, you will need to change scene (e.g. go indoors/outdoors) for the changes to be applied

## Feedback, Questions & Troubleshooting
* I am active on [The Long Dark Modding](https://discord.gg/QvFE7VV4WZ) Discord server
	* **General questions and feedback:** post in my channel #cass
		* Please note that many indoor locations CANNOT be added as they do not have unique scene names. It is too much work to add and maintain these locations!
		* I am open to adding more locations (within reason), contact me on Discord if you have a specific location you really want 
	* **Troubleshooting:** 
		* Post in my channel #cass or in #troubleshooting 
		* Or create an issue here on GitHub if you're not on Discord
